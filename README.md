## Making Of

**Technology:** CSS Modules, React, Next.js, Sequelize, AWS S3

### Authenticating User

Sessions are authenticated with tokens containing user information, which are stored in cookies after verifying credentials. Passwords are hashed using [argon2](https://github.com/ranisalt/node-argon2), and tokens are encrypted using [@hapi/iron](https://github.com/hapijs/iron/tree/master).

### Uploading Multiple Images/Videos

Distinguish the captions and/or tags of each entry in a batch upload by assigning unique indexes to each file and attaching these indexes to their respective inputs.

### Optimizing Image Upload/Retrieval

Before uploading, images are resized and converted to WebP format to reduce file size while preserving sufficient quality.

### Creating Scrapbook Square Masonry Layout

A grid of squares is utilized for the layout, where each entry randomly occupies either 1 square (small) or 4 squares (large), resulting in a square masonry appearance.

### Using SQL Database

A SQL database is used to filter entries based on their creation date, entry type (text, image, video), and tags.

### Storing Image/Video Files

Images and videos are stored in S3. Each file is identified by the user's SQL database ID and the SQL database ID of the entry to which it belongs.

## Known Issues
